# Welcome

Python Create helps you in bringing your Python skills to the next level. This is just a starting point,
where we'll introduce you our one and only super helpful generator for `setup.py` files.

This website has been developed by Python-enthusiasts, lacking of serious web development skills,
yet wanting to experiment a bit with React.

## Future plans

The current content is just the beginning, and we're aiming for creating more useful generators we ourselves
frequently need as well to finally get satisfactory answers to questions for creating:

- a `pyproject.toml` file,
- pre-commit hooks,
- and a Docker image to run your Python project.

We're open to suggestions. Please submit issues you find or feature suggestions to our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/bartcode/pythoncreate/issues).

## FAQ

- **Why shouldn't I use Python packages that help set up my project?**

> You can.
> However, sometimes it's a bit of an overkill to install a package that does some wizardous actions for you. With Python Create, we're trying to offer transparant tools that show you how your code changes based on your needs.

- **How come there are already frequently asked questions when this website hasn't been live for so long?**

> These are made up.

- **Can I contribute to this website?**

> [YES, PLEASE.](https://github.com/bartcode/pythoncreate/issues)

- **How can I contact these React losers?**

> In the unlikely event that anyone ever reads this, you can leave your love or hate speeches on the [Issues](https://github.com/bartcode/pythoncreate/issues) page.
