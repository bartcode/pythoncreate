# `setup.py` generator

Setting up your project with a proper `setup.py` can be a pain in the buttocks. Especially
when you really, _really_, want to distribute your package to more users than just your dog and two cats.
This tool helps you to get over the big hurdle of publishing a useful tool for co-Python-nerds.

Using the switches below, this tool transparantly shows you what needs to change in your `setup.py`
file to get what you want. Even if you've already almost finished your own code, this might _just_ answer
the question how you can include package data, classifiers, or even where to store the version of your package.
