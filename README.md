# Python Create

With [Python Create](https://pythoncreate.com/), we're aiming to create an online platform with generators (and perhaps some tutorials) for
developing proper Python code. Feature suggestions can be submitted to the [Issues](https://github.com/bartcode/pythoncreate/issues)
page of this repository.

## FAQ

- **Why shouldn't I use Python packages that help set up my project?**

> You can.
> However, sometimes it's a bit of an overkill to install a package that does some wizardous actions for you. With Python Create, we're trying to offer transparant tools that show you how your code changes based on your needs.

- **How come there are already frequently asked questions when this website hasn't been live for so long?**

> These are made up.

- **Can I contribute to this website?**

> [YES, PLEASE.](https://github.com/bartcode/pythoncreate/issues)

- **How can I contact these React losers?**

> In the unlikely event that anyone ever reads this, you can leave your love or hate speeches on the [Issues](https://github.com/bartcode/pythoncreate/issues) page.
